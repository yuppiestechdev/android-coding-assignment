### iOS Coding assignment

#### Brief

Implement a scrolling list view like popular social media apps (Instagram/Snapchat/Facebook/Tiktok).


#### Constraints

1. There will be multiple sections in the list. Each section should have a minimum for 5 items. There should be at least 10 sections in the list.
2. The layout of the items in a section must alternate between 2 small items followed by 1 big item. See image below:
3. The section headers should be sticky as the user scrolls through the list.
4. The data used to populate the list can be fake data. Use hardcoded data or pull it from any public API. Hint: Unsplash images can be used as items in a section.
5. Create a GitHub repo with your submission and follow best practices when it comes to commits, naming, code quality and architecture. You will have to explain your decisions.
